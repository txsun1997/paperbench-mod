- Retrieves output from a running or completed background bash shell
- Takes a shell_id parameter identifying the shell
- Always returns only new output since the last check
- Returns stdout and stderr output along with shell status
- Supports optional regex filtering to show only lines matching a pattern
- Supports optional wait parameter to wait X seconds before checking output
- Use this tool when you need to monitor or check the output of a long-running shell
- Always recommend to add wait X seconds (wait=X) to wait for the output to be generated. If your command is running for a long time, you can add a larger wait time, e.g. wait=300 (5 minutes).
