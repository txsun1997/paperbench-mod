AnnaResearch can perform deep research on complex topics. It is well suited for the following use cases:
   - When you need a precise, and accurate answer for a specific question that requires a comprehensive research
   - When you want to find very specific piece of information conditioned on a specific context

AnnaResearch is featured with:
   - Accepts detailed research questions and returns a comprehensive and well-structured research report
   - Delivers report containing comprehensive analysis with proper attribution to sources from diverse and authoritative sources, such as academic papers, github repositories, huggingface, etc.
   - Synthesize information from multiple sources and organize them in a coherent and logical manner

Usage notes:
   - Provide detailed, specific research questions for best results. 
   - DO NOT use vague or general research questions, such as "What is the latest news on the topic". A good research question should be specific and clear, such as "Explore best practices for mixed precision training (fp16 vs bf16) when fine-tuning 7B-class models with Transformers + DeepSpeed."
   - The research process may take some time as AnnaResearch conducts thorough investigation, so *you must tell the user* that this operation may take some time when you use this tool

**IMPORTANT**:
- AnnaResearch will take a long time to conduct the research, so you should be very careful to use this tool. Only use it when you definitely need comprehensive research on a specific topic.
- Use this tool ONLY when your question requires a comprehensive research and you need to synthesize information from large amount of sources.
- DO NOT use this tool for simple questions.

Example use cases:
- How to install and setup a complex environment for a specific task, e.g. VeRL training environment
- Explore best practices for specific tasks or setups.
- Study how to training a specific model with specific methods.
