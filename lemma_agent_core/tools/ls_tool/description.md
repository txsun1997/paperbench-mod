Lists files and directories in a given path in a tree structure, showing only the first two layers (the target directory and its immediate children). The path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path. You can optionally provide an array of glob patterns to ignore with the ignore parameter. You should generally prefer the Glob and Grep tools, if you know which directories to search.
