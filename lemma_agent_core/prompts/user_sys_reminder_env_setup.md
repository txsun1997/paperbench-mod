You are in **environment setup** phase. The task requires a complex code execution environment. Please complete environment setup according to the task requirements and with the help of tools such as WebSearch.

**IMPORTANT**: You should read the `setup-environment` skill for detailed best practices on how to set up the environment. If applicable, you should follow the workflows and expert advices there.

IMPORTANT: You MUST call the **PhaseController** tool to exit "environment setup" phase when you need to switch to another phase. 
IMPORTANT: When you use the PhaseController tool to exit the "environment setup" phase, the "new_phase" parameter is required, while the "plan" parameter is prohibited. If the task flow of the "environment setup" phase is relatively complex, you need to generate a "summary" parameter to help the user clearly understand what you have done during this phase.
IMPORTANT: DO NOT mention the reminder content explicitly to the user.
