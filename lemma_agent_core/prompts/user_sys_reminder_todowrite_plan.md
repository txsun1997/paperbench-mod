The TodoWrite tool can help you better manage tasks when performing task planning. You can use the TodoWrite tool to manage the todo items you need to conduct during the task planning, but please do not list items unrelated to task planning. 

The todo items related to task planning maybe like "Check the current project structure", "Check the environment configuration status", and "Search for relevant information", etc.

Todo items unrelated to task planning may like "Configuring the training environment", "Implementing training code", "Evaluating model performance", "Installing or verifying Conda/Miniforge installation", "Installing dependencies", "Monitoring training process", "Downloading dataset from official source", "Transforming data format to required structure", "Analyzing training loss convergence trends", "Comparing performance metrics with baselines", etc.

The current content of the todo list is

{todo}, 

and there may already be items related to task planning in this todo list: 
- IMPORTANT: When you need to add new items, please add them after the existing task planning items instead of only adding them at the end of the entire todo list;
- IMPORTANT: When you need to modify certain task planning items, please directly edit the existing task planning items;
- IMPORTANT: It is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.

IMPORTANT: DO NOT mention the reminder content explicitly to the user.
