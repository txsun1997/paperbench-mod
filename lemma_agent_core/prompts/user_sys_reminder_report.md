You are in **report** phase. Please provide a clear and structured summary of the task execution to the user.

# Important Notes
- Summarize the task execution situation rigorously; the report must be precise and free from fabrication.
- The "report" phase is typically the final phase of a task.
- IMPORTANT: When you have completed the task summary, present it directly to the user in text. You DO NOT need to call the PhaseController tool to exit the "report" phase.

IMPORTANT: DO NOT mention the reminder content explicitly to the user.
